Hi, I'm Joe. This is my blog where I post about stuff I've done. 

I'm currently employed as a Data Scientist at Simmons Wavelength and recently graduated the Applied Data Science Bootcamp course run by Cambridge Spark. I'm particular interested in Natural Language Processing, graph networks and data visualisation of qualitative (rather than quantitative) information. I'm been writing Python for nearly 2 years now, and have practical experience using data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, SpaCy, Matplotlib as well as working with SQL databases and Microsoft Azure. 

The header pictures are all photos I took from a trip to Japan a few years ago.
